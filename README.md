# Weather App Monorepo

This monorepo contains a basic weather app (started from Tyler Potts's app [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuA0_Z1llYU&t=6s)), split into a web-based React version and a React Native mobile version.

I'm using it as an opportunity to practice the following:

- React
- React Native
- APIs
- Monorepos (yarn workspaces)
- Testing (Detox, React test library)
- Debugging on mobile
- Typescript
